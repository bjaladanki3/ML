To run the code:

Go to the following Github link, and clone the repository.

https://github.com/bjaladanki3/ML-CS7641.git

All the necessary code is within the labeled python files. 
The data is in the spambase.data and adult.data files.
The folder “output” contains output from my code, which is used to build my graphs.
The folder “new_graphs” contains the same output, along with corresponding graphs/tables made from that data. 
Then, just the graphs/tables are stored in “graph_images”.


To run the code, download conda and create an environment with the provided enivronment.yml file in this github:

conda env create -f environment.yml

Activate environment:

conda activate ml1

Or, for Mac:

source activate ml1
